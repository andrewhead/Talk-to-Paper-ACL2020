## Index your own data
You can sign-up for free task at https://app.soco.ai to index your own data. If your index size exceeds the limit, please contact us at [contact@soco.ai] for special offer to researchers and students.

## Dataset
There are two types of data:

### Question-only Data
the first type is question only data that is not linked to specific answer spans in the paper PDF. This question only dataset will be included at \data

### Question-to-answer Data
Due to the challenges of collecting question-answer pairs for academia papers (it requires the annotator to have siginificant expertise in AI/NLP), we have made it possible for anyway to annotate answers and linked questions at https://ask.soco.ai.
